        blurb: `I'm club Chairman. I've skied regularly for the last 20 years, and head to the
                Tarentaise in France as often as I can.  I first took my two boys to Bowles to help
                them with their general skiing skills, and loved the club's unique and friendly
                atmosphere and wonderful natural setting. The competitive element of racing really
                grabbed us all, and we now join as many dry ski races as possible during the summer,
                and plan to do some races on snow over the winter.`
