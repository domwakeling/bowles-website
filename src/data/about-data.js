        blurb: `I am the club Chairman, I have been involved with the race club now for about four
                years. After my children’s second holiday I realised I would have to find something
                to fill the skiing gap until next year and Bowles race club certainly does the
                trick! Although I don’t race myself I am a keen skier and enjoy watching my children
                improve and have fun every week.`

        blurb: `I learnt to ski on a local dry slope in my early 20s and it kick-started my love for
                skiing. Now I support my two sons who train and race with Bowles Ski Racing Club. I
                can clearly see the benefits that training on a dry slope brings to their technique
                when we all ski together in the mountains. Bowles is a relaxed and friendly club and
                I'd encourage you to come along and see what we're all about.`
