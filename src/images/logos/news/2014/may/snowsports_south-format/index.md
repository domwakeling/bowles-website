Message received from the Snowsport South Committee

Dear All,

Fun team races were added to the Snowsport South Race Day format in 2009 when entry numbers were low to ensure that there was a full day's racing. At that time, the day was routinely finishing around 3pm. Now that entry numbers are high, we feel it is time to review the race day format. It is up to you, the racers, to decide which way we proceed.

Last Sunday at Aldershot, we had 186 competitors actually racing. The timings (starting at 8:00 and finishing at 16:30) were:

Open Practice - 1 hour (allowing 2 runs per racer)
3 Individual timed runs - 3.5 hours
Set up of dual and drawing of lists - 0.5 hours
Individual Head to Heads - 2.5 hours
Club Teams - 1 hour

If we had held the Fun Team races, the day would have been approximately 1.5 hours longer.

Suggestions vary between those wishing to have Club team races and those wishing to have Fun teams. If entry numbers stay at the level they are, there is not time for both.

Please let us know what you think by emailing communications@snowsportsouth.org.uk.

Best wishes,
The Snowsport South Committee
