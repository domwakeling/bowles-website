**Details for the Aldershot Winter Series race this Sunday (2nd February).**

The race will be an individual slalom event with the intention being that all racers will get a minimum of 4 runs. Depending on the number of racers and the weather we may be able to run a dual slalom. Racing must be finished by 11:00 when we will hold prizegiving. Stubbies will be used for racers born in 2003 and later.

The agenda for the morning is as follows:
* 07:30 centre opens
* 07:45 registration and bib collection
* 07:45 open practice (no course)
* 08:15 course setting and inspection
* 08:45 first run (poles)
* 11:00 slope must be cleared. Prizegiving if weather permits on the patio.

At registration the 2003 and later racers will be given a different set of bibs from the older racers but in both cases they will be distributed in the order of registration so the first person to register will get bib number 1etc. This will then be the running order for the race itself so the running order will be random in terms of ages and gender. The race is open to anyone from a Snowsport South affiliated club but for non-ASRC members there will be a Â£5 entry fee to cover costs.

If there are any questions please email Brian - chairman@snowsportsouth.org.uk.
