This year's Tri-Regional Race will be at Chatham on 14th October.

The Tri-Regional is a team event, with 8 5-racer teams each from LSERSA, ERSA and Snowsports South.
While Bowles is affiliated to both LSERSA and Snowsports South, LSERSA is the first affilition and
Bowles racers therefore compete for LSERSA at this event.

Any Bowles racer who has taken part in one or more LSERSA race, and is in the U10 category or above,
is eligible. To register interest please email <a href="mailto:ccgravener@aol.com">Claire Gravener</a>
with your child's name,  year of birth, club and T-shirt size. Teams will be selected by Emily
Evans, LSERSA Regional Head Coach, based on both race results for the season and general knowledge
of racer performance.

There is no fee for participating in the race, and all racers get a free race T-shirt (but parents
are asked to volunteer some time towards the running of the race on the day!) This is a really fun
day with a lot of racing (every team will get at least 11 competitive runs) and we hope that Bowles
will be well-represented!
