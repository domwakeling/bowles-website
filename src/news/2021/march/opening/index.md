Bowles centre is planning to re-open on Monday 29 March, meaning that training can resume from
Tuesday 30 March.

As last year, we will be limited to 6 participants on Tuesdays (for a one-hour session starting at
6:30pm) and 15 on Fridays (for the two-hour session starting at 5:30pm). Booking will remain through
the online system, either on the [Booking Page](booking) on this site, or using the dedicated
[Tuesday](https://bowles-tuesday-training.vercel.app/) / [Friday](https://bowles-friday-training.vercel.app/)
'vercel' pages.

Both sessions will cost Â£10 per racer.
