As Covid restrictions are gradually lifted, we are able to start lifting restrictions on numbers for
Friday-night training.

Starting **this Friday** (16th April) we are increasing the participants-limit for Friday night
from 15 to 25.

You should still book training as usual through either the [Booking Page](booking page) on this
site, or using the dedicated [Friday](https://bowles-friday-training.vercel.app/) 'vercel' page.

Tuesdays will remain a one-hour session limited to six racers, and both sessions will remain at Â£10
per racer.

As ever these arrangements may be subject to review.
