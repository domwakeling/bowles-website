Saturday 6th July saw the inaugural SPS Championship held at Aldershot. The competition was open to
all children through to year 8 (age 13). Full results for the individual and team events are
available via the Snowsports South website.

The school team from Lamberhurst St Mary’s - consisting Sebastian Turner-Moore, Oliver Turner-Moore,
Lily Scott and Harrison Scott - placed second in the “Boys U11” team competition.

Although having to “make-do” as an honorary boy in the team competition, Lily also won a medal in
her own right, placing 3rd in the U9 Girls individual competition.
