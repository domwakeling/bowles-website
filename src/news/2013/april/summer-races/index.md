As the dry and indoor slope race season is about to kick off with our fun race and we have a number
of new racers who may not be fully aware of the options available, Mark has kindly provided some
details; these can be found in more detail on the Facebook page (see link above the calendar on the
right of this page).

In summary, Bowles racers can compete in races organised by:

* [London & South East Region](http://www.lsersa.org/races13/index.html#series) (LSERSA)
* [Southern Region](http://www.srsa.org.uk/seasons) (SRSA)
* [Club National](http://www.britski.org/) and other national races
* [Kent Schools](http://www.lsersa.org/races13/raks/index.html)

National races are often restricted to "racers registered with home nation" which means you need to
be [registered with Snowsports England](http://membership.snowsportengland.org.uk/memberlogin.asp)
(also called SSE) as a racer. Note this is an individual registration, separate from the
registration that the Race Club has with Snowsports England.
