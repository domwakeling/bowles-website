At long last, the competition for the Bowles logo re-design is open.

Logos should be black-on-white and can be submitted either as ‘hard copy’ (give them to Marna at training) or by email to logocompetition@bowlesskiracingclub.org.uk. If you’re feeling creative, feel free to submit as many entries as you want!

Entries will be open until the end of March, after which Nigel, Simon and Tim Owens will select the final design. The winner will receive a club t-shirt with the new logo.
